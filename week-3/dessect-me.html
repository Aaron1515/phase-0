      Main article: Citrus taxonomy
    </h2>

    <p>
      All citrus trees belong to the single genus Citrus and remain almost entirely interfertile. This means that there is only one superspecies that includes grapefruits, lemons, limes, oranges, and various other types and hybrids.[9] As the interfertility
      of oranges and other citrus has produced numerous hybrids and cultivars, and bud mutations have also been selected, their taxonomy is fairly controversial, confusing or inconsistent.[7][10] The fruit of any citrus tree is considered a hesperidium,
      a kind of modified berry; it is covered by a rind originated by a rugged thickening of the ovary wall.[11][12]

    Different names have been given to the many varieties of the genus. Orange applies primarily to the sweet orange – Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck. The orange tree is an evergreen, flowering tree, with an average height of 9 to 10 m (30 to 33 ft), although
    some very old specimens can reach 15 m (49 ft).[13] Its oval leaves, alternately arranged, are 4 to 10 cm (1.6 to 3.9 in) long and have crenulate margins.[14] Although the sweet orange presents different sizes and shapes varying from spherical to
    oblong, it generally has ten segments (carpels) inside, and contains up to six seeds (or pips)[15] and a porous white tissue – called pith or, more properly, mesocarp or albedo—lines its rind.[16] When unripe, the fruit is green. The grainy irregular
    rind of the ripe fruit can range from bright orange to yellow-orange, but frequently retains green patches or, under warm climate conditions, remains entirely green. Like all other citrus fruits, the sweet orange is non-climacteric. The Citrus sinensis
    is subdivided into four classes with distinct characteristics: common oranges, blood or pigmented oranges, navel oranges, and acidless oranges.[17][18][19]

  <p>
    Other citrus groups also known as oranges are: Bitter orange (Citrus aurantium), also known as Seville orange, sour orange (especially when used as rootstock for a sweet orange tree), bigarade orange and marmalade orange. Like the sweet orange, it is
  a pomelo x mandarin hybrid.[20] Bergamot orange (Citrus bergamia Risso), grown mainly in Italy for its peel, producing a primary essence for perfumes, also used to flavor Earl Grey tea. It is a hybrid, probably bitter orange x limetta.[21] Trifoliate
  orange (Poncirus trifoliata), sometimes included in the genus (classified as Citrus trifoliata). It often serves as a rootstock for sweet orange trees and other Citrus cultivars.[22] Mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata) is an original species of citrus,
  and is a progenitor of the common orange. An enormous number of cultivars have, like the sweet orange, a mix of pomelo and mandarin ancestry. Some cultivars are mandarin-pomelo hybrids, bred from the same parents as the sweet orange (e.g. the tangor
  and ponkan tangerine). Other cultivars are sweet orange x mandarin hybrids (e.g. clementines). Mandarin traits generally include being smaller and oblate, easier to peel, and less acidic.[23] Pomelo traits include a thick white albedo (rind pith, mesocarp)
  that is more closely attached to the segments.

    Orange trees generally are grafted. The bottom of the tree, including the roots and trunk, is called rootstock, while the fruit-bearing top has two different names: budwood (when referring to the process of grafting) and scion (when mentioning the variety
    of orange)

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

<header>
<nav>
<aside>
<section>
<article>
<footer>

  I'll be using nav, section, and header about 90% of the time.  It seems like footer is a good idea, however div does the same thing.  But I may have a use for it later as we progress on.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

  Content are laid out by Header, footer, section, article, aside, body, nav.  They will get styled with CSS most of the time.

  The brower first read the DOCTYPE, to determine what type of html it will use to decode the site.
  Then I will look into the head of the website, Beside the title in the head, most of the other things you will put in the head is back end contents.  Back end content consist of charset, links to CSS, search engine tags, meta tags, and much much more.
  It has read all the info on the head, it will move to the body of of the webpage.  This is where the end user will beable to see and interact with the website that you have created.



What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

Createing snippets are fun, I have to create another custom snippet dependins on what i'll be building in the coming chapters.  I'm more of a manual guy myself, I don't mind typing out a few codes.  There's a few addon's I can add to sublime that makes my life eaizer but because I want to learn to type the code and I would prefer to type of until I have it down with memory muscle then i'll switch to short cuts.  Same reason why we write code in source rather than learning a program that helps us write out a code.  I even try to limit myself on the copy and paste.
