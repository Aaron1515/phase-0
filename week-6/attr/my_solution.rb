How are they modifying or returning the value of instance variables?



Release 2: Identify the Changes

What changed between the last release and this release?
What was replaced?
Is this code simpler than the last?



Release 3: More Changes

Open release_3.rb. Run the code and read both the comments and the code. Notice where the code changed. In the reflection section of the my_solution.rb file, answer the following questions:

What changed between the last release and this release?
What was replaced?
Is this code simpler than the last?



Release 5: Apply



Release 6: Reflect

On your own, create a commented section in your my_solution.rb file and write a (or create a video) reflection that answers the following questions:

What is a reader method?
What is a writer method?
What do the attr methods do for you?
Should you always use an accessor to cover your bases? Why or why not?
What is confusing to you about these methods?
