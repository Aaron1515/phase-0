# Implement a Reverse Polish Notation Calculator


# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# Pseudocode

# Input: Range of object or an array of objects
# Output: Take that array or range or object and display 1 random item from that array or range.
# Steps:

# Create a CLASS to perform this operation
# Initialialize the the first method that except a object

# Create a method for sides

# Create a method for random roll once.


# Initial Solution

class Die

  def initialize(labels)
    if labels = 0
      raise ArgumentError.new('I need more than an array that has something in it.')
    end

  @sides = lables
  end

  def sides
    if @sides == 0
      return 0
    elsif
    @sides.length
    end
  end

  def roll
    @sides.sample
  end
end
