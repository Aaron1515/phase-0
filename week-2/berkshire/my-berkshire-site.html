    <!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It's pretty easy so far, I did have to google how to use the copyright symbol.  It seems pretty fun as well took.  I can't wait to style it with html

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
I took the codecademy class on html/css a month or 2 ago so this is more of a refresh.
I have to research the how to link the mail to again, because I have forgoten that.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
I try to keep in mind that in html there's not much styling and I will wait till next week when we add CSS to it to improve the looks of it.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
The good part of it is, keeping it simple and get the right text in.

The bad is shere's no good styleing in HTML, that's where CSS will come into play.  You can do it in html but you would have to do a lot if you want to change 1 part of it or multi - parts of your html.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I just remember the basic concept of HTML5, such as the
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title></title></head>
<body>"Everything in here"</body>
</html>

This is my cheat sheet for writing HTML
