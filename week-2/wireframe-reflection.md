What is a wireframe?

  Wireframe is an image you can draw out digitally or with paper and pen.  Just a rough sketch how it will look on the browser.  On the top theres a few example of wireframe that I drew out using Balsamiq Mockup.

  Here's the link for the app I used. https://balsamiq.com/


What are the benefits of wireframing?

  Keep the program on track to know what the end result should look like.


Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

  Wireframing isn't has fun as the coding part.  But its a part that has to be done so if youre creating an project, how it will appear on the screen.


Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

  I did a few revision till it look the way I want.  When ideas comes to mind it starts to get over complex.  I did it with a time boxing so I don't go down a huge rabbit hole.


What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?

  I asked what is a wireframe-blog-index.  I wasn't sure if it was a quesiton for if I should make a list or an image.  Understanding wireframe helps a bit more.  And I did get the "ah" moment when I reach out and asked Lucas.


Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

    I found reading some of the things that tells you it should be in phase-0 instead of [username].github.io confusing.
