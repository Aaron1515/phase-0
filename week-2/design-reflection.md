What is your site's primary goal or purpose?
  To inform users of how my experiance with DBC is.

What kind of content will your site feature?
  It will mainly focus on blogs of my week to week experiance with DBC.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
  People that wants to join the DBC family or have alumni see what changes from when they started.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
  My primary 'action' would be to have visitors read my experiance and see the work I do.
  Have a way of contacting me of additional quesitons that I could answer one off.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
  Keep in mind that the website should be cater toward the user interface not a programmers view.  The audience should be for the none tech.  Keeping it simple and easy to use.
  Main thing about design to keep in mind is how easy it is to use.  It should be an experiance that they can go in a website and use it without many other distractions.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
  I can name a lot why user experiance design is soooooo important.  With out a free flowing website its just some times too much clutter or not enought to keep an user excited about the page.  There's a lot that comes into play, such as grammer, where things are layed out, how easy it is to navigate through the site, where to pay for things, and most importantly keep the attention span of the user.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
  I didn't find anything tedious, if it is.  It's just more practice.
