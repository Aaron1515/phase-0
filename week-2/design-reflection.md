##2.3 Introduction to Design and Site Planning Reflection


###What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?


  1. Information Gathering
      What is he purpose of the site, what are you goals, who is your target audience, and what type of content will you be showing on your site?
      These are just some of the questions that needs to be asked to get some info on what you'll be creating.  There will be more info plus you might also want to create a mood board for the site.
  2. Planning
      From what you gathered already from your ideas.  What are the main topics of the site?  This is where you will draw out your wire frame for the site.  List out the main topics and what end user will be doing on the site.  Such as are the end users coming to this site to buy something? or just for information?
  3. Design
      Designing the page with wireframe and how the looks and feel for the end user.  This is where you could find colors and themes that match the website you'll be building.  Visually it should like appealing to anyone.
  4. Development
      At this point you're acutally making the website.  This is the coding part of the website.  Since you have all the images from the previous stages.  It's time to add the image and codes to the website to make it look like your wireframe.
  5. Testing and Delivery
      Testing the website either manually or with an app to test the website of traffic flow and bad codes.  Never should you pass a website before checkingit out with a website validator or with soemone else.  You'll always want a second set of eyes looking at your codes.  No one wants to be disappointed to get a post production and things aren't working corrently.
  6. Maintenance
      There will be a few ways of keeping maintences on the web.  One is to have the end client keep maintenace with new content with apps of course.  Or actally hiring an web developer and maybe an UX designer to keep updates on new contents.

The website [here](http://www.idesignstudios.com/blog/web-design/phases-web-design-development-process/#.VmYaGuMrI6V) really explains the 6 phase really well.

###What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

My site will consist of my experiance, blogs, projects, and links about my journey through DBC.  I know may people like myself have a lot of questions about how to start DBC and what to know before starting.  Before I started I didn't find any website that has info of person experiance beside a one page article.


###What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My targent audience will be people that don't know how to code or starting off to code and would like to get their fee wet and learn what being a web developer will be like taking a journey in my shoes.  It will help to give people the chance to see what it will be like learning code and the challenges to be come one.  As a new web developer I can relate to people that doens't know how to code one bit.


###What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

The primary "action" will be to gain knownledge about a life of a non coder to a web developer.  I would offer time line storyies, blogs, web links, and even my contact info for one off questions.

It will offer potential employers to see my resume from my posted projects.

It will have different actions on the top of the site for different visitors so they know what they are looking for.  Both beginner or non programmers and potential employers will be able to get a sence of what I learned.



###What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?


There's a few things you will need to know about design and UX.  The user experiance needs to be simple.  Look at apple, everything they make is simple but there's always a hidden side to apple when you choose to open that up.  Such as terminal on Apple computers.  Other things is there's going to be many different users that will log on to your site, you can't just cater to just one type of user.  As in user experiance you'll have to have image to keep the vistors entertained.


###What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

User experiance is how the website flow.  It's valuble because if a site is hard to buy things or load very slow.  You'll lose the attention span of your visitors.  Second thing is always have new content.  No one like to go a restaurant and always order one place everytime.  It goes borning.  Experiance needs to be fun, easy, and new all the time.


###Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I found the reflection tedious.  I'm sure when I look back at this it will reflect how far I have gone.
