What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
  1. Gathering information
      Gathering information on what the site is used for.  How would it be used.  Who is the website targeting.
  2. Planning
      There's various stages of plan.  How you want the site to look and act for you targeted audiance.
  3. Design
      Designing the website for user friendliness.  How easy is it to navigate.
  4. Development
      This is where the coding challenging part is.
  5. Testing and Devlivery
      Test the website durning every stage to insure that it work corrently and before you delivery the final project.  It should be tested again.
  6. Maintenance
      There's a couple ways to have the maintence for the site.  Either you it could be a user friendly way to keep maintence or no maintence at all.  Or it could also be an on going maintence with new content all the time.  That will depends on the client which works better for them.

What is your site's primary goal or purpose?
  To inform users of how my experiance with DBC is.  Show my projects that was designed and created by me.

What kind of content will your site feature?
  It will mainly focus on blogs of my week to week experiance with DBC.  Small sample projects, maybe in the future it will offer some vidoes as well.

What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
  People that wants to join the DBC family or have alumni see what changes from when they started.  Or even people that might want to pick up coding.

What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
  My primary 'action' would be to have visitors read my experiance and see the work I do.
  Have a way of contacting me of additional quesitons that I could answer one off.  Seeing small coding that I do.

What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
  Keep in mind that the website should be cater toward the user interface not a programmers view.  The audience should be for the none tech.  Keeping it simple and easy to use.
  Main thing about design to keep in mind is how easy it is to use.  It should be an experiance that they can go in a website and use it without many other distractions.

What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
  I can name a lot why user experiance design is soooooo important.  With out a free flowing website its just some times too much clutter or not enought to keep an user excited about the page.  There's a lot that comes into play, such as grammer, where things are layed out, how easy it is to navigate through the site, where to pay for things, and most importantly keep the attention span of the user.

Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
  I didn't find anything tedious, if it is.  It's just more practice.
