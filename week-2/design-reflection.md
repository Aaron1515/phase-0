What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?


  1. Information Gathering

      What is he purpose of the site, what are you goals, who is your target audience, and what type of content will you be showing on your site?


  2. Planning

      From what you gathered already from your ideas.  What are the main topics of the site?


  3. Design

        Designing the page with wireframe and how the looks and feel if the website.


  4. Development


      This is where the site comes to life with the images you found in your design phase.  Adding content and adjusting the look and feel when you drew out the wireframe.


  5. Testing and Delivery

      Testing the website either manually or with an app to test the website of traffic flow and bad links.


  6. Maintenance

      There will be a few ways of keeping maintences on the web.  One is to have the end client keep maintenace with new content with apps of course.  Or actally hiring an web developer and maybe an UX designer to keep updates on new contents.


The website http://www.idesignstudios.com/blog/web-design/phases-web-design-development-process/#.VmYaGuMrI6V really explains the 6 phase really well.

What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

      My site will consist of my experiance, blogs, and links about my journey through DBC.


What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

      My targent audience will be people that don't know how to code or starting off to code and would like to get their fee wet and learn what being a web developer will be like taking a journey in my shoes.  It will help to give people the chance to see what it will be like learning code and the challenges to be come one.  As a new web developer I can relate to people that doens't know how to code one bit.


What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

      The primary "action" will be to gain knownledge about a life of a non coder to a web developer.  I would offer time line storyies, blogs, web links, and even my contact info for one off questions.

      It will offer potential employers to see my resume from my posted projects.

      It will have different actions on the top of the site for different visitors so they know what they are looking for.



What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?


      There's a few things you will need to know about design and UX.  The user experiance needs to be simple.  Look at apple, everything they make is simple but there's always a hidden side to apple when you choose to open that up.  Such as terminal on Apple computers.  Other things is there's going to be many different users that will log on to your site, you can't just cater to just one type of user.  As in user experiance you'll have to have image to keep the vistors entertained.


What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

      User experiance is how the website flow.  It's valuble because if a site is hard to buy things or load very slow.  You'll lose the attention span of your visitors.  Second thing is always have new content.  No one like to go a restaurant and always order one place everytime.  It goes borning.  Experiance needs to be fun, easy, and new all the time.


Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

      I found the reflection tedious.  I'm sure when I look back at this it will reflect how far I have gone.
