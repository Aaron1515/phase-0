## 1.1 Think About Time Reflection


Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?

A few time management that was learned was time boxing and my favorite was Pomdoro Technique.  There as a lot of productivity that we learned durning watching the videos and reading.  Just to name a few wold be mediations, being mindful of others, breaking down huge tasks into smaller pieces.



What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?

Time boxing is setting and agreed time to finish small task with a group or person rather than finishing or completing the whole project on an agreed time.  With smaller task, we can figure need time and help from and to others during completion of each set time box.



How do you manage your time currently?

I currently set time apart to complete task currently.  However I will start using the Promodoro Technique, it seems the most appealing to me.



Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?

My current strategy is working for me at this time, but I want to find a more affective way to learn.  Its working for me because I keep myself focus and try not to steer myself into watching television or doze off.



Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?

I think there’s a few I would use and try them for a bit.  Not every technique will work for everyone, nor is every technique correct for one person.  In order to see which one works best for me, I’ll start to try to ones that seems to make more sense to me and work myself down the list.



What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?

My over all time management is a big juggle between work, family, and dev boot camp.  There are things that will take a way time from what I will be doing and I understand I can’t be in two place at once  and my body needs rest.  But I will try to do my best and I didn’t pay to waste money.  I’ll give it my all and learn all that I can.


## 1.2 The Command Line Reflection


What is a shell? What is "bash?
A shell is an user interface with the system operating system, a bash is or bash script is a tool to work within a shell.

What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
The most difficult is the researching part, some fun and some not so fun. haha

Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
Yes, I learned DOS in the 80's so its some what similar.  Just have to learn the syntax but I got the concept down.

In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?
cd .. / pwd / mv / cp / touch / it also seems like all the other ones we went over are also equally important.  I know there's much more than what we learned but those are the most important ones at this time.

Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
-pwd - print working directory

-ls - list

-mv - move

-cd - change directory

-../ - ../ doesn't do anything, it should be ".." go down an directory

-touch -  create a few file

-mkdir - make directory

-less - page through file

-rmdir - remove directory

-rm - remove file

-help - is to show help screen for command line or --help could be used for specific commands



## 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection


If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?

Creating a repo using GitHub is very easy doing it on the website.  First log in to your GitHub account via any browser.  First visit the website and log in and click new repository.  Then you want create a name for your repository and this is where you can make it public or private.  Then the final step is initialize the repo with license.  Then you would click on create repo.  Seeing that this repo is already under your account you wouldn’t need to fork it unless you the repo isn’t under your username.  Copy the url that is provided to you then you can clone it to your computer using git.  By doing this you will open terminal and get to the directory where you want to clone of this repo is reside in.  Once you choose your directory type “git clone ‘then your url goes here”.  Then get up and say “I’m awesome!”.  And you are done creating a repo and cleaning it to your computer.

Forking a repo lets you link it to your GitHub account and you can refer back to the “master copy” of the repo anytime.  You would want to fork it rather making a whole new one because you would not want to waste time doing something someone already has made one and you can work off it.



What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?

Didn’t get any issues setting up git or Github.  I learned how and work git and github does and how to use it after using it.
