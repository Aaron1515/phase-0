# Pseudocode




# Initial Solution

class GlobalCohort
  #your code here
  def initialize(name, city, email)
    @name = name
    @city = city
    @email = email

end

class LocalCohort < GlobalCohort
  #your code here
  def initialize(name, city, email)
  end

  def p0_start_date
  end

  def graduation_date
  end
  def students
    @name.each { |x| puts x }
