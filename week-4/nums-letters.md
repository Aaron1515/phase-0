#4.2 Numbers, Letters, and Variable Assignment (medium)


##What does puts do?

````puts```` will print the output to the console and creates a new line, if you are trying to continue the whole out-putting and not skip a line.  Then you might want to use ````prints```` instead of puts.

##What is an integer? What is a float?

Interger is a whole number.  A float is a number with a decimal point, even a number like 4.0 is a float.  4.0 is a whole number but it has a decimal point, it is a float.

##What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

I shall give an example for it.

Integer division.
If you divide :> 7 / 4        :> 1

Float division
if you divide :> 7.0 / 4      :> 1.75

As you can see using interger for division you don't get the remainder and if you use float you will get a exact answer in math.


##Mini-challenges

####Hours in a year
````puts 365*24```` = 8760 Hours

####Minutes in a decade
````puts 10*365*24*60```` = 5256000 Minutes

This is concidering that there's no leap years.

#Reflection

##How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
Addition (+)(br /)
:>1 + 1
:>2
Subtraction (-)
:> 2 - 1
:> 1
Multiplication (*)
:> 3 * 3
:> 9
Division (/)
:> 3 / 3
:> 1
Ruby handle simple math like a calculator.  For more complex math it could use tan, sin, and you can also create your own method to do math.

##What is the difference between integers and floats?
In ruby intergers when used it doesn't give you decimal point or remainders in divisions.  Floats could be used as whole numbers by doing 4.0 as the number 4 and it will give you the most accurate answer in doing math.

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

##What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
Strings are an infinite sequence of charathers that can contain numbers, letters,symbols, and punctuation marks.  Becareful with some punctuation marks such as " ", they can take you out of the string.  By defeated the "" in side of your string you can use "/" to ignore the ending of your string.
Strings are mostly used to print something on the screen for the end user to see or testing your code.


##What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
Local variable is only contained on that file and not on another file.  If you have multiply files, those variables will not carry over to another file.

##How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
This was a great basic review of ruby and what we had learn before the interview.  I always enjoy a review before we start the harder challenge and a nice refresh.
